              <p class="clubs_introduction">Art is envisaged to be an integral part of life. The Fine arts club at IIT Kanpur helps its members to develop an aesthetic sense, to let their imagination run wild, and provides them with a platform to showcase their talents, be it in the form of artifacts or performing arts (speed/sand art). It provides an environment for creative minds to learn, expand their horizon, take initiatives, materialize their imagination, and of course, have lots of fun.</p>
